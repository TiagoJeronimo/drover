Hello!

Here I present my version of the search page from [Drover Search Page](https://www.joindrover.com/cars/search).
As I didn't get much time I tried to make a bit of everything. We have some filters and the list of cars resulting from the search of those filters.

For most of the components I implemented some snapshot tests, you can check below how to run them.

For the sake of simplicity of the design of the dropdowns and the location input I used the package [Semantic UI React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
